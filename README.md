## Inspiration ✨
In today’s era, skincare is important to help our skin stay in good condition. However, we have trouble remembering when it expires. Moreover, many skincare products put their expiration date on the packaging, not the product. So, we decided to make Skination help solve that problem.

## What it does 👩🏻‍💻
Skination will give a reminder if the skincare that we use is going to expire. We just need to add the skincare that we bought, the ID, and the expiration date. It also has a review page where users can share their experience on using a product, and info if a product is on sale (and linked it to the e-commerce platform where the product is on discount).

## How we built it 🔧
Firstly, we made the mockup in Figma and then built the front end with CSS, Javascript, and HTML. 

## Challenges we ran into ❗️
We have a really rough start, we were started as a group of four that come from different countries (Indonesia, Nigeria, and the United States). The major time difference made it hard for us to work together. Moreover, two of us are first-time hackers. Unfortunately, one of our teammates left the group without saying anything. However, we still want to make it work and continue with anything we could do. 

## Accomplishment that we’re proud of 🏅
We refuse to give up despite the major challenges that we faced, successfully making this project in less than two or even a day. 

## What we learned 📚
We learned the importance of communication, perseverance, and not giving up easily. We also were able to develop skills and collaborate with the different aspects of our hack, including the presentation and use of new services and programs that we previously have not worked with. 

## What’s next 🔮
We would like to add a filter to sort specific products and give a recommended place to purchase the skincare. Additionally, we also think this could be implemented in groceries and other items in the future. We intentionally designed and built our main hack’s idea around the idea of versatility - and hope that it can and will be incorporated and adopted across other fields.
